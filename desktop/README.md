# Jason Desktop

An Electron window onto the installation the `jason` command line uses. It is one more client of that installation, as
the browser UI is: it finds the data directory as the CLI does (`JASON_DATA_DIR`, otherwise `~/.jason`), shows the UI the
runtime serves at its loopback address, and changes the installation only through CLI verbs and the settings file a
person would edit.

## What it does, and through what

| Step | How |
| --- | --- |
| Know whether a runtime is up and whether it is this build | `jason status` |
| Start one when none is up | `jason runtime start` (never `jason runtime run` as a child of its own) |
| Install the UI | `jason ui install`, only when the runtime is the version the desktop carries and the `ui_module` check of `jason status` is not ok; an install that fails stops the start only when no UI is served at all |
| Deploy the skills | `jason skills install --roles-only`, `jason skills install --root <data>/desktop/chat/.claude/skills --host claude_code` and `jason skills install --root <data>/desktop/chat/.agents/skills --host codex`, all from the skills package the desktop carries |
| Load the window | the link `jason ui open --no-open` prints |
| Place a notification plugin | `jason plugin install <id>`, its settings written, then `jason plugin reload` and `jason plugin list` |
| Wire Reply after a sign-in (`reply auth login`, or `--with-token` with the key on standard input) | `reply auth status --json` for the profile, `jason plugin install reply`, its settings written, then `jason plugin reload` |
| Say whether Reply is wired | `jason plugin list` shows `reply` valid, and `jason route list` names it the global default |

When the runtime is another version, the UI it serves is loaded as it is and `setup.status()` says the versions differ
and names `jason update`. A `feed` in the desktop's settings is passed to every verb that takes `--feed`.

## Its own files

- `<data>/desktop/settings.json`: the desktop's settings (`feed`, and the version whose skills were last deployed).
- `<data>/desktop/chat/`: the chat's working folder; its skills, Jason's and the Reply ones, are in `.claude/skills/` for
  Claude Code and in `.agents/skills/` for Codex.
- `<data>/desktop/provider-keys`: AI providers' keys, encrypted by the operating system (`safeStorage`).
- `<data>/desktop/electron/`: Electron's own files (its profile, the page's storage, and in `logs/` what Electron itself
  logs), set before anything else, so a second data directory is a second desktop and nothing of it lands outside
  `<data>`.
- `<data>/logs/desktop-YYYYMMDD[_NNN].jsonl`: its log, in the runtime log's shape and under the same limits
  (`Logging:RetainedFileCountLimit`, `Logging:FileSizeLimitBytes`). `jason logs --source desktop` reads it.

A Connect card also writes, into `<data>/config/settings.json`, the keys of the plugin it configures and no other:
`Plugins:Config:<id>`, `Plugins:Grants:<id>:Http` and `Notifications:Plugins:<id>:Binding`, each section made only when
a value is written into it. The `Http` grant is written only where there is none, or where the server or receiver it
derives from changed, so a grant you wrote yourself (a server of your own for ntfy, say) outlives a new token or topic.
The Reply card writes `Plugins:Grants:reply:Exec` (`["reply"]`, only where the grant does not already hold
`reply`, so one you widened is kept) and, only where the file names no `Routes:Default` at
all, `Routes:Default` with the profile signed in (`{"Plugin": "reply", "Binding": {"profile": "default"}}` unless
`reply auth status` names another), as the golden path writes them by hand; a default you set is kept. No other
`Routes` key is ever written, and every other key is kept as it was.

A file the desktop cannot parse is refused and left as it is: the runtime reads comments and trailing commas, and the
desktop, which writes plain JSON, will not rewrite them away. A target is checked against the pattern the plugin's
binding declares before anything is written, and an empty one is refused. A card with no values runs only
`jason plugin reload` and `jason plugin list`, and a reload that cannot read the settings file is what
`setup.status().settingsRefused` says.

| Plugin | Token | Target | Grant |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `slack` | `Plugins:Config:slack:token` | `Notifications:Plugins:slack:Binding:channel` | `slack.com` |
| `telegram` | `Plugins:Config:telegram:token` | `Notifications:Plugins:telegram:Binding:chat` | `api.telegram.org` |
| `ntfy` | none: `NTFY_TOKEN` is read from the runtime's environment only | `Notifications:Plugins:ntfy:Binding:topic`, and `server` beside it for a server of your own | `ntfy.sh`, or that server's host |
| `journal-forwarder` | `Plugins:Config:journal-forwarder:token` | `Plugins:Config:journal-forwarder:url` | the receiver's host |

The desktop never writes an `Env` grant (ntfy's `NTFY_TOKEN`) or a `Subscriptions` grant (the journal kinds the
forwarder is admitted to); each card's note says where those are set.

## The window

- The page is the runtime's own, at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`; navigation is locked to that origin. A link or
  `window.open` that leaves it goes to the system browser only when it is `https:`.
- `contextIsolation` on, `nodeIntegration` off, `sandbox` on; no webview attached, and of the permissions a page asks
  for only `clipboard-sanitized-write` is granted, to the runtime's origin alone, so a Copy button works.
- The preload exposes `window.jasonDesktop` and nothing else. Every call is answered only when it comes from the top frame
  of a page at the runtime's origin (`src/ipc.ts`); a subframe, another origin and a `file:` page are refused.

## Processes

Every process is started with a file and arguments, never through a shell, and only by the named modules:
`src/cli.ts` (the bundled `jason`), `src/programs.ts` (the agent hosts, `reply`, `node` and `npm`), `src/shell-path.ts`
(on macOS only, the login shell's PATH, read before anything is started) and `scripts/prepare.mjs` (`dotnet publish`).
On Windows, a program npm installed is a batch file; the desktop reads which script it hands to Node and starts that
with Node. `test/process-guard.test.ts` holds this, and also refuses a `require` of `child_process`, an IPC handler
registered anywhere but `src/ipc.ts` (on `ipcMain` or on a `webContents.ipc`), `shell.openPath`, and `shell.openExternal`
outside the navigation lock in `src/main.ts`.

## Updating and taking it off

Before an update installs, the desktop stops the runtime its own `jason` runs as, with `jason runtime stop`, and goes no
further when that runtime does not stop, or when the run file names a runtime that did not answer while the process it
names still runs (`src/own-runtime.ts`); it asks only the data directory it was started with.

On Windows the installer and the uninstaller also look for any process running from the carried `jason.exe`, whichever
data directory started it, and never close one (`installer/uninstall.nsh`). A person's uninstall starts the application
with `--uninstall`, which stops the runtime it carries, takes off the PATH command's files that are its own, Open Jason
at Login and the runtime's start at logon when it starts this application's `jason`, and names what it leaves: the data
directory, the harness root and the updater's cache.

On macOS there is no installer, so nothing looks when Jason.app is moved to the Trash, and the desktop's own look before
an update is the whole guard. Before removing Jason.app, take off by hand what it placed:

1. In the Jason menu, turn off Open Jason at Login and Start the Runtime at Logon.
2. Run `jason runtime stop`.
3. In the same menu, under Command Line, choose Remove jason from the PATH (or Remove jason-desktop from the PATH, by the
   name it was put there with), then quit Jason.

What stays: the data directory (`~/.jason`, or the one `JASON_DATA_DIR` names), the harness root (`~/Jason`, or the one
`Harness:Root` names) and the updater's cache, `~/Library/Caches/jason-desktop-updater`.

## Building and testing

From `desktop/`:

```sh
npm ci
npm run check         # the type-check of the sources and the tests
npm test              # the Node tests
npm run prepare:bundle -- --pre rc.1   # publishes this checkout's jason into bundle/ as <VersionPrefix>-rc.1
npm run dev           # builds and starts the window
```

A desktop build always carries a candidate's version string (`0.34.0-rc.1`), never `dev`, so `jason ui install` and
`jason plugin install` resolve that candidate's own release directory. `test/candidate-version.test.ts` proves it against
a local feed when `JASON_UI_ZIP` names a UI build packaged with `JASON_VERSION` set to the candidate.

A package is built from `electron-builder.config.mjs` at the version `JASON_VERSION` names, a release's or a candidate's,
around a bundle prepared for each architecture at that same version. On Windows, unsigned:

```sh
node scripts/prepare.mjs --rid win-x64 --output bundles/x64 --version 0.34.0-rc.1
JASON_VERSION=0.34.0-rc.1 npm run package -- --win --x64   # dist/: the nsis installer, latest.yml, win-unpacked/
```

The release passes `--executable` with the `jason` it has already built and signed, so the package carries that very
file, and signs the package itself: a Mac package is never built unsigned. Inside `app.asar` are `lib/`, `shell/`,
`resources/` and the chat's two lists; beside it, in the package's `resources/`, are `bundle/` (the executable with
`LICENSE` and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES`, the skills and `version.json`) and `notices/` (the repository's `LICENSE`, this
folder's `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES` and Chromium's `LICENSES.chromium.html`). The package carries no UI: `jason ui install`
places the UI of the runtime's own release.

To run it against an installation other than your own, set `JASON_DATA_DIR` and `JASON_Harness__Root` in the environment
it is started from.
